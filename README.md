# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This is a take-home project I did for a big Bank. 
In this project, I developed a solid way to detect fraud cases in a highly imbalanced dataset (e.g., less than 2% of cases were marked as fraud).
I spent most of my time on feature engineering (creating additional predictive variables based on available data) and on picking a good resampling technique, but all the efforts were worth it. 
The model performance has been significantly improved.
Note: Since I only have a weekend to work on this, it can be further improved and I will keep working on improve the model performance.
